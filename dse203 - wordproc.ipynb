I said, \"What do you know about him?\", and she said, \"Open Sesame\". And I said, \"Yes, this is the name!\" Then I went on to the street and found 30 people and asked them, \"Do you know Alibaba?\" People from India, people from Germany, people from Tokyo and China ... they all knew about Alibaba. Alibaba – open sesame. Alibaba is a kind, smart business person, and he helped the village. So ... easy to spell, and globally known. Alibaba opens sesame for small- to medium-sized companies.

      "On 4 April 1999, Jack Ma and his team of 17 friends and students founded Alibaba.com, a China-based B2B marketplace site, in his Hangzhou apartment. In October 1999, Alibaba received a US$25 million investment from Goldman Sachs and SoftBank. Alibaba.com was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an e-commerce platform for Chinese enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to help export Chinese products to the global market as well as address World Trade Organization (WTO) challenges. In 2002, Alibaba.com became profitable three years after launch. Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system, so from 2003 onward, Alibaba launched Taobao Marketplace, Alipay, Alimama.com, and Lynx.[25][26]\n",

      "When eBay announced its expansion into China in 2003, Ma viewed the American company as a foreign competitor and rejected eBay's buyout of Alibaba's subsidiary Taobao. Through applying existing technologies and gaining trust in the Chinese e-commerce market, as well as expanding through dominating the market at a loss before making a return on additional services, Alibaba's subsidiaries outperformed eBay in the Chinese e-commerce market, claiming a growing percentage of consumers from eBay. Alibaba subsidiary Taobao would later force eBay out of the Chinese market, with eBay closing its unprofitable China Web unit, though the two companies would break even six years later.[25][27][28]\n",

On 18 September 2014, Alibaba's IPO priced at US$68, raising US$21.8 billion for the company and investors. Alibaba was the biggest US IPO in history, bigger than Google, Facebook, and Twitter combined.[34][35][36] On 19 September 2014, Alibaba's shares (BABA) began trading on the NYSE at an opening price of $92.70 at 11:55 am EST.

      "In 2003, Alibaba launched Taobao Marketplace (淘宝网), offering a variety of products for retail sale. Taobao grew to become China's largest C2C online shopping platform and later became the second most visited web site in China, according to Alexa Internet.[51][52] Taobao's growth was attributed to offering free registration and commission-free transactions using a free third-party payment platform.[53] Advertising made up 75 percent of the company's total revenue, allowing it to break even in 2009. In 2010, Taobao's profit was estimated to be ¥1.5 billion (US$235.7 million), which was only about 0.4 percent of their total sales figure of ¥400 billion (US$62.9 billion) that year, way below the industry average of 2 percent, according to iResearch estimates.[53] According to Zhang Yu, the director of Taobao, between 2011 and 2013, the number of stores on Taobao with annual sales under ¥100 thousand increased by 60%; the number of stores with sales between ¥10 thousand and ¥1 million increased by 30%, and the number of stores with sales over ¥1 million increased by 33%.[54]\n",

It became the eighth most visited web site in China as of 2013.[55] In 2012, Tmall.com later changed its Chinese name to Tianmao (天猫, \"sky cat\"), reflecting off of Tmall's Chinese pronunciation.[56] In March 2010, Taobao launched the group shopping website Juhuasuan (聚划算), offering \"flash sales\", which are products that are available at a discount for only a fixed time period. In October 2010, Taobao beta-launched eTao, a comparison shopping website that offers search results from mostly Chinese online shopping platforms,[57] including product searches, sales and coupon searches. According to the Alibaba Group web site, eTao offers products from Amazon China, Dangdang, Gome, Yihaodian, Nike China, and Vancl, as well as Taobao and Tmall.[47] As part of a restructuring of Taobao by Alibaba, these spin-offs became separate companies in 2011, with Tmall and eTao becoming separate businesses in June and Juhuasuan becoming a separate business later in October.[58]\n",

      "In 2010, Alibaba launched AliExpress.com, an online retail service made up of mostly small Chinese businesses offering products to international online buyers. It is the most visited e-commerce website in Russia.[59] It allows small businesses in China to sell to customers all over the world, resulting in a wide variety of products. It might be more accurate to compare AliExpress to eBay, though, as sellers are independent; it simply serves as a host for other businesses to sell to consumers.[60] Similar to eBay, sellers on Aliexpress can be either companies or individuals. It connects directly Chinese businesses with buyers. The main difference from Taobao is that it's aimed primarily at international buyers, mainly in USA, Russia, Brazil or Spain.[61]\n",

      "Previously, Jack Ma served as the CEO of the Alibaba Group since its creation, but later stepped down on 2013, choosing Jonathan Lu as his successor.[148][149] The Alibaba Group under Lu was performing well, though there were rumors that Ma was growing distrustful in Lu's ability to lead the company.[150][151] Daniel Zhang, who served as COO of Alibaba under Lu, succeeded Lu as CEO in 2015.[152] On 10 September 2018, Ma chose Zhang to succeed him as executive chairman of the Alibaba Group after his stepping down announcement, and this would go into effect in 1 year on 10 September 2019.[153] Since 2012, the Communist Party of China has had a Group Party Committee in place in the company and has over 2,000 party members as Alibaba employees.[154] In 2019, the Chinese government began embedding officials inside of major technology companies, including Alibaba.[155]\n",

      "Alibaba.com offers a paid Gold Supplier membership to try to ensure that each seller is genuine; sellers' Gold Supplier status and the number of years it has been held are displayed.[156] The supplier verification types and checks are listed on Alibaba.com's website, with more stringent checks for sellers outside China.[157] While the majority of suppliers are reported to be genuine,[citation needed] there have been many cases of sellers, some with Gold Supplier status, seeking to defraud unsuspecting buyers.[158] In February 2011, controversy ensued when Alibaba's corporate office admitted that it had granted the mark of integrity of its \"China Gold Supplier\" program to more than 2,000 dealers that had subsequently defrauded buyers; the firm's share price dropped \"abruptly\" after the announcement.[159] A statement from the firm reported that Yan Limin, the general manager of Alibaba.com at the time, had been dismissed in March for \"misconduct\"; Phil Muncaster of UK's The Register additionally reported that \"a further 28 employees had been involved in dodgy dealings\".[160]\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Economist noted, the company's response has conflicting components: Alibaba's promulgated view that its corrective actions indicate its commitment to quality and integrity (where it contrasts itself with other scandal-associated Chinese business sectors), versus a damage control view suggesting that the subscription-driven, third-party verified \"China Gold Supplier\" program was endangered by diminished trust in its endorsement system, removing the incentive for global buyers to choose Alibaba as their business-to-business service, thus more broadly endangering Alibaba through impact on its brand and capabilities (the latter via the \"defenestration of senior people\").[159] The scandal was said to have placed the head of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma—who was described as having been furious over the scandal—in a position to personally fight to win back trust.[161]\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2012, a US law enforcement agent posing as an American broker representing persons in Iran posted an advertisement on Alibaba.com seeking to purchase uranium. In August 2013, Patrick Campbell of Sierra Leone was arrested at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Samples of raw uranium ore were allegedly found concealed in the soles of his shoes. Campbell was accused of seeking to arrange the export of 1,000 tonnes of yellowcake from Sierra Leone to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, packed in drums and disguised as the mineral chromite.[162] It was later determined that the samples contained an insignificant amount of uranium, and Campbell was acquitted at trial.[163]\n",

      "Alibaba is frequently associated with fraudulent import of counterfeit items: in 2016, the Office of the United States Trade Representative added Taobao back onto a list of notorious counterfeit platforms that includes the likes of torrent site The Pirate Bay.[164]\n",
      "\n",
      "Alibaba denied wrongdoing and started timid action against counterfeiters with only two lawsuits filed as of January 4, 2017[update],[165] but brands suffering from the counterfeit products continue to blame Alibaba for not doing what it takes to fight the issue.[166]\n",
      "\n",
      "Alibaba and the underwriters of its IPO were sued in California in a consolidated class action lawsuit.[167]  The lawsuit was brought in San Mateo Superior Court in October 2015 on behalf of investors who purchased Alibaba's American Depositary Shares, and it alleged violations of the Securities Act.[168] Alibaba reached a settlement agreement in December 2018, subject to court approval, in which it agreed to pay $75 million to settle the lawsuit.[167][169][170]\n",
